# IMDb-2024-Data-Scraping
This project is a comprehensive data scraping and analysis workflow that extracts movie data from IMDb's 2024 listings. The goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize the data for deeper insights. Using Selenium, Pandas, SQL, and Streamlit, we have created an interactive dashboard for exploring IMDb movie data by genre, rating, votes, and more.
